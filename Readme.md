## Key Components

### 1. **Synthetic Data Generation**
- **File**: `SinteticDataFactory.ipynb`
- **Description**: 
  - Contains the code to generate synthetic datasets for testing the model.
  - Demonstrates how to create and load data using pandas DataFrames.
  - Provides a structured skeleton (`SenecaLibreModel`) with clear guidelines for implementing the MDMCVRP solution.
  - Includes placeholders for data preparation, cost matrices, model building, and constraints.
- **Usage**:
  - Modify parameters to customize datasets.
  - Export datasets for different cases.
- **Purpose**: 
  - Serve as a starting point for building optimization models.

### 2. **Model Skeleton**
- **File**: `class-based-model.py`
- **Description**:
  - An example Python script showing how to structure a class-based model using Pyomo.
---

### 3. **HiGHs Solver Tutorial**
- **File**: `HiGHsSolverTutorial.ipynb`
- **Description**:
  - Explains how to install and configure the HiGHs solver for Pyomo.
  - Provides example optimization problems solved using HiGHs.
- **Usage**:
  - Follow the notebook to understand solver integration.
  - Test basic linear programming problems with HiGHs.

## Datasets

The repository includes several cases, each with its corresponding dataset:

- **`case_1_base/`**: Basic example for initial testing.
- **`case_2_cost/`**: Includes a harder situation that is a lot closer to the real problem.
- **`case_3_supply_limits/`**: Includes depot capacity constraints.
- **`case_4_multi_product/`**: Adds multiple products and constraints.
- **`case_5_recharge_nodes/`**: Adds recharge nodes for the vehicles.

Each case contains:
- `Clients.csv`: Client location and demand data.
- `Depots.csv`: Depot location data.
- `Vehicles.csv`: Vehicle capacity, range, and other parameters.

> **Note**: You can swap Depots.csv with single_depot.csv for single depot if your inital model is for a single depot.

For advanced cases:
- `DepotCapacities.csv`: Specifies product limits for each depot.
- `RechargeNodes.csv`: Details recharge node locations and attributes.
